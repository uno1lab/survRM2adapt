Description: Estimates the restricted mean survival time (RMST) with the time window [0, tau], where tau is adaptively selected from the procedure, proposed by Horiguchi et al. (2018) <doi:10.1002/sim.7661>. It also estimates the RMST with the time window [tau1, tau2], where tau1 is adaptively selected from the procedure, proposed by Horiguchi et al. (2023) <doi:10.1002/sim.9662>.
